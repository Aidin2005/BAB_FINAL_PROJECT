# project title: Library Management System
## Description:
The Library System is an object-oriented programming project aimed at simplifying library management. Its purpose is to provide an efficient platform for handling books, users, and daily operations.
Key Functionality:
Book Management: Add, edit, or delete books with details like title, code, description, category, price, author, and publisher.

User Management: Facilitates user signup and login using username, password, and email.

Search and Organization: Supports book searches and categorization, with configurable settings for categories, authors, and publishers.

Daily Operations: Manages book rentals and returns, tracking book name, operation type (rent/retrieve), and rental duration.

Reporting: Exports operational reports to Excel files.

Settings: Enables management of categories, authors, and publishers for streamlined organization.

The system ensures intuitive, scalable, and organized library operations for administrators and users alike.

## Project Requirements List:
Here’s a list of 10 essential features for your Library System project to ensure it runs smoothly and meets its goals. These are designed to make the system practical and user-friendly:
Add New Books: Allow administrators to easily input a new book with details like title, code, description, category, price, author, and publisher.

Edit Book Details: Enable admins to update book information, such as the title or price, to keep the catalog current.

Delete Books: Provide a way to remove books from the system when they’re no longer needed.

User Signup: Offer a simple process for users to create accounts with a username, password, and email.

User Login: Implement secure access for users to log in using their credentials.

Book Search: Include a search feature to help users find books by title, author, category, or code.

Category Management: Let admins create, modify, or delete categories to organize books effectively.

Track Daily Operations: Record book rentals and returns, including the book name, operation type (rent or return), and rental duration.

Generate Reports: Create reports, like rental activity or inventory summaries, and export them to Excel for review.

Manage Authors & Publishers: Allow admins to maintain accurate author and publisher details by adding, editing, or removing them as needed.

These features form the foundation of a functional and organized library system, balancing ease of use with efficiency for both administrators and users.
